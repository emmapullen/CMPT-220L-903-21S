Emma Pullen Binary Search Tree:
For my search tree, I created functions/methods to insert,delete, find the minimum, maximum, height, search, and traverse the tree. These functions are defined in 
the DummyBST class, initialized in the Node class, and called in the main class/
While all of these methods do not run perfectly, the foundation of the correct method is there. Therefore, there is no demo to be submitted.
